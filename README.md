# supervised-learning-classification-pipeline

This project involves a Jupyter Notebook designed for supervised learning tasks, particularly classification. The notebook includes data loading, preparation, and analysis using Python. Below is an overview of the key steps and functionalities.

## Structure and Highlights

### 1. Library Imports
The following libraries are utilized for data processing:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Data Loading
The notebook reads data from a CSV file named `propensao_revenda_abt.csv`. File paths are dynamically managed (in some cases using Google Colab integration):
- **File Handling**: Paths are defined and accessed using the `os` library.
- **Google Colab Support**: Includes optional integration with Google Drive for data storage and access.

### 3. Data Preparation
Key steps include:
- **Variable Categorization**:
  - `key_vars`: Variables like `data_ref_safra` and `seller_id` used as identifiers.
  - `num_vars`: Numerical features such as `tot_orders_12m` and `receita_12m`.
  - `cat_vars`: Categorical features like `uf`.
- **Target Variable**: `nao_revendeu_next_6m`, likely representing a binary classification target.
- **Feature Selection**: Combines categorical and numerical variables into a feature set for further analysis or modeling.

### 4. Data Exploration
The initial exploration uses:
- **`df.head()`**: To preview the dataset.
- **Variable Selection**: Ensures focus on relevant columns for the classification task.

## How to Use
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python libraries: `pandas`.
   - Access to the dataset `propensao_revenda_abt.csv`.
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
   - Ensure the dataset file is in the correct path.
3. **Customize Variables**:
   - Modify `num_vars` or `cat_vars` as needed to include additional features.

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements include:
- Incorporating additional preprocessing steps, like handling missing values.
- Adding visualization for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Implementing a machine learning model for classification.

## Dataset
- **Name**: `propensao_revenda_abt.csv`
- **Description**: Contains data related to sales propensity, including customer and transaction attributes.
